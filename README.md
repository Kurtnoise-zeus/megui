# MeGUI 6666 version

During summer 2022, I upgraded the [current megui codebase](https://sourceforge.net/p/megui/code/HEAD/tree/megui/trunk/) in order to fix some issues and add some new features. 

The current branch has been **tested only on x64 dev environment** (Avisynth+, Windows 11 Pro Edition).


## Compilation

Just open the MeGUI.sln file using Visual Studio. I'm using VS2022 Community Edition in order to compile the latest changes.


## Release

From time to time, I upload directly on [github Release page](https://github.com/Kurtnoise-zeus/megui/releases) a package having latest changes and/or fixes. Use it at your own risk.

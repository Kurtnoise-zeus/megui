2930 [Progress Window]      improved the job progress window in several ways. major ones are:
                            - processing rate got renamed to speed and is now also showing the current speed
                            - the current speed is used to calculate the remaining time
2929 [MP4/MKV Muxer]        use the full fraction of the frame rate (e.g. 24000/1001) when available. Bug #968
     [MediaInfo]            added the frame rate numerator and denominator to the log output
2928 [DGIndexNV]            updated to support the free version. Patch by Donald Graft (#672)

2924 [OneClick]             fixed missing jobs if the mux job does not contain any subtitles (regression of 2921)
2923 [AviSynth Profiles]    ensured that every template has the crucial entries for input, crop and resize. Bug #951
2922 [QAAC]                 fixed not able to encode. Bug #954 (regression of 2914)
2921 [OneClick]             subsequent jobs in batch mode and the cleanup job will be created in any case
2920 [Video Encoder]        improved job abort behavior
2919 [Main]                 improved error handling when copying the redist files
2918 [Profile Selector]     fixed new profile not available immediately. Bug #953
2917 [L-SMASH Indexer]      always show source and cachefile (if available)
2916 [FFmpeg AAC Encoder]   fixed quality mode using the wrong number format (regression of 2904)
2915 [L-SMASH Indexer]      added support for recent versions
                            enabled VC-1 decoding support

Features/Changes:
[Worker]               improved worker handling
                       - for each job type the process and I/O priority can be defined
                       - changing the priority in the progress window does change it only for the current job
                       - rule sets can be specified based on which it is determined how many jobs of which type are allowed to run in parallel
                       - settings to be found in the options window

[AVS Script Creator]   if resize with DGIndexNV is enabled also cropping will be done that way (mod4 is forced for crop values)


Known Problems:
- Windows Vista and older are not supported
- Unicode is not supported
- M2TS bitrate calculator does not calculate correct values as the specifications are unknown
